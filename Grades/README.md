This is an analysis I've made on my grades in Musicology, at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens where I am a student. I made this list initialy to keep track of my grades, but then I continued and made some interesting plots and statistics for fun! The  last update I've made is at 28/5/2020. I will come back later and complete the list, when I pass some more lessons (soon I hope). I took the data from the https://my-studies.uoa.gr/ page, where our grades are stored, however I had to 'clean' the data in Excel and later in R. The names of the lessons and the variable names are in Greek language. 

So these are the files I have uploaded :

**Grades.md** is the analysis I've made. There are some plots and statistics regarding my grades in Musicology.\
**Grades_matrix.md** is a matrix with the data I've used (lessons, grades, etc.) before 'cleaning' it in R.\
**Grades.Rmd** is the code I used for the presentation in R.

I hope you enjoy and maybe get some ideas for your personal projects!
